# The_Endo_Enigma
This is where I am documenting my journey of analyzing and visualizing data on Endometriosis in Nigeria with the aim of increasing awareness, empowering Endometriosis research and revolutionizing Endometriosis Care. 
The data I analysed was gotten from a qualitative study done by EndoSurvivors International Foundation to ascertain the awareness level of endometriosis amongst adolescents at the Youth Friendly Centres in Lagos State and Investigate the attitudinal approach of adolescents towards menstruation, menstrual pain and menstrual hygiene; using the Lagos State Youth Friendly Centres as a case study.
